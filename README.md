# Beginner Python Project: Department Spending Analysis

This project demonstrates beginner‑friendly Python data analysis using **pandas** and **matplotlib**.  
It takes raw transaction data and walks through the full workflow: cleaning messy fields, validating column names, converting amounts to numeric, and aggregating total spending by department.  
The analysis produces polished visualizations with professional formatting, saved as images for quick review.
